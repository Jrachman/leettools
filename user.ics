DESCRIPTION:The UCI Student Housing group wishes to develop an easy to use 
 social app ("ZoTribe") for On Campus Housing. It lets the students living 
 on campus easily find out who their neighbors are\, organize/attend events
 \, post classifieds (for subleasing\, buying/selling)\, enable convenient 
 rent/utilities bill payments\, track lost and found items\, and post emerg
 ency alerts.\n\nThe purpose of this assignment is to learn how to write a 
 fairly complete and precise requirements specification\, which is a critic
 al step in developing a large software system. Completing this assignment 
 will give you experience in one of the most interesting and difficult soft
 ware engineering tasks.\n\nThis assignment is to write a software requirem
 ents document for the ZoTribe system. The details of the requirements shou
 ld be elicited by client interviews with your TA during lecture (see [Cour
 se Schedule] (https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/16427/pages/course-schedu
 le)). He will act as customer. Your document should be based solely on the
  information discussed in these interviews. Do not add any requirements ot
 her than what was discussed in these interviews.\n\nThe deliverable is an 
 electronic PDF copy due via Canvas by the due date. The following late pol
 icy applies: Assignments turned in within 24 hours after the deadline will
  receive a 50% penalty. No assignments will be accepted after that.\n\nWe 
 provide a [template Word document] (https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/164
 27/files/5864359/download?wrap=1) with which you should start (see Files s
 ection of Canvas). Your requirements specification should contain all of t
 he sections contained in this template. There are some student samples in 
 the Files section of Canvas for guidance.\n\n \n\nScoring\n\nThe scoring 
 criteria are outlined in the rubric below. Throughout the document we will
  be looking for:\n\n* Adherence to the stated structure. Carefully follow 
 the structure defined above.\n\n* Clarity of writing. You should write you
 r document in clear\, precise\, business-like English prose\, avoiding jar
 gon\, humor\, and wordiness. Correct spelling and correct grammar are esse
 ntial. Avoid acronyms\; common ones should be defined when first used. Bul
 leted and numbered lists can be used\, with restraint\, and not as a subst
 itute for complete sentences and readable prose.\n\n* Fidelity to customer
 's desires. It is important that your document be true to the requirements
  stated by the customer. Don't add or remove requirements without approval
 . When in doubt\, ask the professor or TA – but only for clarification p
 urposes (no new requirements).\n\n* Your document should address all aspec
 t of system functionality and constraints which are important to the user.
 \n\n* Your document will contain many detailed requirements. Careful thoug
 ht is necessary to ensure that no subtle contradictions are introduced.\n\
 n* State detailed requirements in a manner that facilitates determining wh
 ether they are met in the final implementation.\n\n* Avoiding implementati
 on bias. Focus on "what" not "how".\n\n* Modularity and separation of conc
 erns. Try to divide each section into subsections or paragraphs which are 
 largely independent of each other. Ideally\, each requirement or feature i
 s discussed in its entirety in one place.

DESCRIPTION:Homework 2 will introduce you to the concepts and software behi
 nd version control\, using the example of Git.\n\nThe assignment consists 
 of several parts.\n\n \n\nPart A\n\nPart A focuses on installing Git and 
 becoming familiar with its basic concepts and commands.\n\nThere's no ques
 tion that installing software can be tricky. If you run into problems\, fi
 rst Google them. If that doesn’t help\, post them on Piazza with as much
  detail as possible\, and help will soon be on the way.\n\n \n\n* Read [P
 ro Git] (http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/)\, (http://www.git-scm.com/book/e
 n/) by Scott Chacon. Read all of chapter 1 except 1.5 and 1.6. Read sectio
 ns 2.1-2.4 of chapter 2.\n\n \n\n* Choose how you will use Git:\n\n* Inst
 all Git on your Windows computer. Download the installer from http://git-s
 cm.com/downloads and run it. For the rest of the homework\, use the Git Ba
 sh option (aka the Git Bash shell)\, not the Git GUI option. All your Git 
 commands are entered in the "Git Bash" window\, and all output will appear
  there.\n\n* Install Git on your Mac computer. Download the installer from
  http://git-scm.com/downloads and run it. For the rest of the homework\, a
 ccess git through Terminal.\n\n* SSH (for example\, using [PuTTY] (http://
 www.putty.org/) (http://www.putty.org/)) to openlab.ics.uci.edu to remotel
 y access Git on the computer lab's Linux environment.\n\n* Go to the ICS c
 omputer lab. The Linux machines should have Git installed.\n\n \n\n* Note
 : Bash and Terminal (on a Mac) are examples of a "shell"\, a Unix concept 
 that has proved quite durable. In a shell (or command prompt window) you c
 an enter commands which cause actions\, such as listing\, creating\, and d
 eleting files. Some useful commands that work in the Git Bash shell and in
  Terminal:\n\n* cd (change directory)\n\n* pwd (print working directory)\n
 \n* ls -al (list all\, one per line)\n\n \n\n* Run the command git help\,
  and take a screen print showing the results. (On a Windows machine\, use 
 Alt-PrintScreen to put the active window image in the clip board. On a Mac
 \, see http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/screencapturemac/ht/macscreenshot.
 htm). Paste the screen print into a Word file\n\n \n\n* GitHub is a widel
 y used location to store git repositories. You'll probably need a GitHub l
 ogin name in your later courses or in your software engineering career. If
  you don't have an account on GitHub.com\, create one at https://github.co

DESCRIPTION:In Part B you will create a local repository and perform basic 
 operations on it.\n\n \n\n* Create (somewhere on your computer) a new emp
 ty folder named Inf43Hw3. In that folder\, create a plain text file with y
 our name and student ID # on a single line. Don't use MS Word for this\, u
 se a text editor\, for example Notepad or TextEdit (you may need to choose
  Plain Text under Format or Preferences). Save the file as file1.txt.\n\n
  \n\n* In your Git shell\, navigate to Inf43Hw3. Use the cd command to ch
 ange your current folder/directory (Google it if you don’t know). Note t
 hat the Windows Git Bash shell follows Unix/Linux shell conventions so if 
 you're on Windows\, you still need to use Linux-style paths with forward s
 lashes (e.g.\, c:\\my_folder\\my_subfolder would be /c/my_folder/my_subfol
 der). Linux commands like ls\, pwd\, and grep should all work in the Git B
 ash shell.\n\n \n\n* Note: At this point you may find that Git wants you 
 to tell it your name and email address. You can do this with two commands 
 like these:\n\n* git config --global user.name "Peter Anteater"\n\n* git c
 onfig --global user.email "panteat@uci.edu"\n\n* To look at all your confi
 guration information: git config --global -l\n\n \n\n* Create a local Git
  repo by running the command git init.\n\n \n\n* Run git status. Note tha
 t file1.txt is listed as untracked. We want Git to track it\, so run git a
 dd file1.txt. When you "add" a file you are telling Git to keep track of i
 t. "add" also tells Git to stage the file\, which means put it in the stag
 e of being ready to be committed.\n\n \n\n* Run git status Note that file
 1.txt is now listed as a file to be committed (i.e.\, it's staged).\n\n \
 n\n* Let's commit file1.txt to our repository. Run git commit -m "Committi
 ng a new file with my name". When you "commit\,"\, you in effect copy all 
 staged files to the repository. The "-m" is a flag (that's what the hyphen
  indicates) which tells Git that the following string is a message to reco
 rd with the commit.\n\n \n\n* Run git log. This will display the history 
 of changes made to the repository. The one and only entry will be for the 
 commit of file1.txt you just did.\n\n \n\n* Edit file1.txt and change the
  spelling of your name to something incorrect. Save file1.txt with the err
 or. (This small error stands in for a long complex series of edits that yo
 u want to undo.)\n\n \n\n* Run git reset --hard. "reset --hard" removes a
 ll uncommitted changes\, so all files in the repo will return to their con
 tents as of the latest commit. There are many ways to undo changes in git\
 , and "reset --hard" is generally considered to be dangerous. Look at file
 1.txt and observe the effect of reset --hard.\n\n \n\n* Edit file1.txt to
  remove your student ID# and include the name of your major\, and save the
  file.\n\n \n\n* Commit with git commit -m "Now has my major". This doesn
 't work. Git tells you there are "changes not staged for commit".\n\n \n\
 n* Try again with git commit -a -m "Now has my major". The power of the "-
 a" flag is that it tells git to automatically stage all tracked\, modified
  files before the commit.\n\n \n\n* You can also explicitly stage a file.
  Add the name of your favorite restaurant and favorite movie to to file1.t
 xt\, save it\, and run git stage file1.txt. Now run git commit -m "Added f
 avorite restaurant" to commit. "git stage" is really just another name for
  "git add".\n\n \n\n* You set the commit message to "Added favorite resta
 urant"\, but the file also includes your favorite movie\, so maybe we shou
 ld have included that in our commit message. Amend your commit message wit
 h git commit --amend -m "Added favorite restaurant and movie".\n\n \n\n* 
 Run git log to make sure you have successfully changed history.\n\n \n\n*
  You removed your student ID# a few steps back. Let that edit stand in for
  deleting\, a few months ago\, a block of code that you now want to examin
 e. git will help you go back in time. Note that each commit has long\, see
 mingly random\, string of hexadecimal digits associated with it. This is c
 alled a "hash" and is a unique identifier for the commit. Find the hash as
 sociated with the “Committing a new file with my name“ commit. Run git
  checkout xxxx\, replacing xxxx with the first four digits/characters from
  that hash (thankfully typing in the entire hash is not required). You wil
 l see a frightening message about a detached HEAD.\n\n \n\n* git can keep
  track of separate\, parallel\, streams of edits to a project. Each stream
  of edits is called a branch\, and a branch can have a name. For instance\
 , multiple programmers who are working on and commiting changes to the sam
 e file will probably establish different branches. HEAD is git-ese for the
  current (not necessarily the last) commit in the current branch. Since we
 've gone back in time and are potentially (but haven't yet) starting a new
  branch\, HEAD is "detached" (from any established\, named branch). Ouch!\
 n\n \n\n* Take a look at file1.txt and note the later-deleted Student ID#
 . Now to return to the present: git checkout master. "master" is the name 
 of the default branch created when the repository was made. Look at file1.
 txt again. Run git log again and you'll see it has the same three commits.
 \n\n \n\n* Create a new text file called file2.txt that contains your exp
 ected graduation year and first job title on a single line.\n\n \n\n* Sta
 ge file2.txt\, and then commit it with a useful message.\n\n \n\n* Run gi
 t log. Notice that you see log entries for both commits that you've perfor
 med.\n\n \n\n* Run git log file2.txt. Notice that you only see the log en
 try involving file2.txt.\n\n \n\n* Modify file1.txt to have the name of y
 our favorite color on a new line.\n\n \n\n* Delete file2.txt.\n\n \n\n* 
 Run git status. Note that file2.txt is listed as deleted. Also note that t
 he status information helpfully says "git add/rm ..." to update what will 
 be committed.\n\n \n\n* You use the git add command to stage a new or mod
 ified file. However\, to stage the deletion of a file\, you need to use th
 e git rm So run the commands git add file1.txt and git rm file2.txt to set
  the stage.\n\n \n\n* Commit the changes with the commit message "Deletin
 g file2.txt".\n\n \n\n* Run the command git log -p -3. The -p flag will s
 how you the diffs for each change. The -3 will limit what's displayed to t
 he last 3 log entries. Take a few minutes to look carefully at the output 
 log and see if you can figure out how to interpret it.\n\n* Note: A comman
 d such as git log sends text output to the shell using a bash command name
 d "less" to display one windowfull of output at a time ("less" is named af
 ter a similar\, earlier utility named "more"\, in a classic example of hil
 arious techie humor). At the : prompt\, you can press h for help\, q to ex
 it\, Enter to advance one line\, or Space to advance one screenfull.\n\n 
 \n\n* Now you decide you actually wanted to keep file2.txt\, but you delet
 ed it! Fortunately\, you had added it to git\, so you can still get it bac
 k. There are several ways to do this. The simplest is probably to use the 
 command git checkout HEAD~1 file2.txt. What does this do? HEAD represents 
 the most recent commit or snapshot. ~1 tells Git to go back one version fr
 om the most recent snapshot (i.e.\, HEAD). In this older snapshot\, file2.
 txt still existed\, and checkout tells Git to retrieve it. If you now look
  in your folder\, you'll see file2.txt. And is file1.txt changed?\n\n \n\
 n* Run git add file2.txt to stage file2.\n\n \n\n* Run git status. Note t
 hat file2.txt is staged. Commit it with the commit message "Re-adding file
 2.txt".\n\n \n\n* Run the command git log -p to see all of the log entrie
 s.\n\n \n\n* Now run the command git log -p > git_log_partB.txt. (The > i
 s a shell command that redirects the output of the program on >'s left to 
 the file named on >'s right.)\n\n \n\n* Open git_log_partB.txt. It should
  like just like the output you saw for step 33. If you're on Windows and v
 iewing it in Notepad\, the spacing will probably look wrong\, so try openi
 ng it in a different text editor (like Wordpad or Notepad++).\n\n \n\n* U
 pload git_log_partB.txt to the Canvas before the deadline.

 git stage" is really just another name for "git add".</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </
 p>\n<ol start="15">\n<li>You set the commit message to "Added favorite res
 taurant"\, but the file also includes your favorite movie\, so maybe we sh
 ould have included that in our commit message. Amend your commit message w
 ith <strong>git commit --amend -m "Added favorite restaurant and movie"</s
 trong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="16">\n<li>Run <strong>git log</
 strong> to make sure you have successfully changed history.</li>\n</ol>\n<
 p> </p>\n<ol start="17">\n<li>You removed your student ID# a few steps ba
 ck. Let that edit stand in for deleting\, a few months ago\, a block of co
 de that you now want to examine. git will help you go back in time. Note t
 hat each commit has long\, seemingly random\, string of hexadecimal digits
  associated with it. This is called a "hash" and is a unique identifier fo
 r the commit. Find the hash associated with the “Committing a new file w
 ith my name“ commit. Run <strong>git checkout xxxx</strong>\, replacing 
 <strong>xxxx</strong> with the first four digits/characters from that hash
  (thankfully typing in the entire hash is not required). You will see a fr
 ightening message about a detached HEAD.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start
 ="18">\n<li>git can keep track of separate\, parallel\, streams of edits t
 o a project. Each stream of edits is called a branch\, and a branch can ha
 ve a name. For instance\, multiple programmers who are working on and comm
 iting changes to the same file will probably establish different branches.
  HEAD is git-ese for the current (not necessarily the last) commit in the 
 current branch. Since we've gone back in time and are potentially (but hav
 en't yet) starting a new branch\, HEAD is "detached" (from any established
 \, named branch). Ouch!</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="19">\n<li>Take 
 a look at file1.txt and note the later-deleted Student ID#. Now to return 
 to the present: <strong>git checkout master</strong>. "master" is the name
  of the default branch created when the repository was made. Look at file1
 .txt again. Run <strong>git log</strong> again and you'll see it has the s
 ame three commits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="20">\n<li>Create a n
 ew text file called file2.txt that contains your expected graduation year 
 and first job title on a single line.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="2

 n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="22">\n<li>Run <strong>git log</strong>. Noti
 ce that you see log entries for both commits that you've performed.</li>\n
 </ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="23">\n<li>Run <strong>git log file2.txt</stro
 ng>. Notice that you only see the log entry involving file2.txt.</li>\n</o

 our favorite color on a new line.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="25">\
 n<li>Delete file2.txt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="26">\n<li>Run <s
 trong>git status</strong>. Note that file2.txt is listed as deleted. Also 
 note that the status information helpfully says "git add/rm ..." to update
  what will be committed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="27">\n<li>You 
 use the <strong>git add</strong> command to stage a new or modified file. 
 However\, to stage the deletion of a file\, you need to use the <strong>gi
 t rm</strong> So run the commands <strong>git add file1.txt</strong> and <
 strong>git rm file2.txt</strong> to set the stage.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\
 n<ol start="28">\n<li>Commit the changes with the commit message "Deleting
  file2.txt".</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="29">\n<li>Run the command 
 <strong>git log -p -3</strong>. The -p flag will show you the diffs for ea
 ch change. The -3 will limit what's displayed to the last 3 log entries. T
 ake a few minutes to look carefully at the output log and see if you can f
 igure out how to interpret it.\n<ul>\n<li>Note: A command such as <strong>
 git log</strong> sends text output to the shell using a bash command named
  "less" to display one windowfull of output at a time ("less" is named aft
 er a similar\, earlier utility named "more"\, in a classic example of hila
 rious techie humor). At the <strong>:</strong> prompt\, you can press <str
 ong>h</strong> for help\, <strong>q</strong> to exit\, <strong>Enter</stro
 ng> to advance one line\, or <strong>Space</strong> to advance one screenf
 ull.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="30">\n<li>Now you de
 cide you actually wanted to keep file2.txt\, but you deleted it! Fortunate
 ly\, you had added it to git\, so you can still get it back. There are sev
 eral ways to do this. The simplest is probably to use the command <strong>
 git checkout HEAD~1 file2.txt</strong>. What does this do? HEAD represents
  the most recent commit or snapshot. ~1 tells Git to go back one version f
 rom the most recent snapshot (i.e.\, HEAD). In this older snapshot\, file2
 .txt still existed\, and checkout tells Git to retrieve it. If you now loo
 k in your folder\, you'll see file2.txt. And is file1.txt changed?</li>\n<
 /ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="31">\n<li>Run <strong>git add file2.txt</stron
 g> to stage file2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="32">\n<li>Run <stron
 g>git status</strong>. Note that file2.txt is staged. Commit it with the c
 ommit message "Re-adding file2.txt".</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="33
 ">\n<li>Run the command <strong>git log -p</strong> to see all of the log 
 entries.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="34">\n<li>Now run the command 
 <strong>git log -p &gt\; git_log_partB.txt</strong>. (The <strong>&gt\;</s
 trong> is a shell command that redirects the output of the program on <str
 ong>&gt\;</strong>'s left to the file named on <strong>&gt\;</strong>'s ri
 ght.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="35">\n<li>Open git_log_partB.txt.
  It should like just like the output you saw for step 33. If you're on Win
 dows and viewing it in Notepad\, the spacing will probably look wrong\, so
  try opening it in a different text editor (like Wordpad or Notepad++).</l
 i>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start="36">\n<li>Upload git_log_partB.txt to the
  Canvas before the deadline.</li>\n</ol>

DESCRIPTION:Part C\n\nMuch of Git's power comes from the interaction betwee
 n your local repository and remote repositories. Remote Git repositories h
 elp you collaborate with others on a software project.\n\nThere are severa
 l services out there that will host a remote git repository for you for fr
 ee\, the most popular of which is GitHub.com. GitHub.com is particularly p
 opular among the open source community\, and there are pieces of software 
 you probably use every day that are hosted on GitHub.com. Reddit (reddit.c
 om) is one such software (web application) that is maintained on Github\n\
 n \n\n* Let's use git to view the Reddit source code repository hosted on
  GitHub. Start git\, use cd to navigate to an empty folder\, and run the c
 ommand git clone https://github.com/reddit/reddit.git.\n\n \n\n* You now 
 have a local copy (on your computer) of the remote repository. It's import
 ant to understand that this is not only a copy of the source code\, but al
 so a copy of the history of changes stored by git. And since it's a local 
 repository\, all the commands you used in the previous part of the assignm
 ent will work. To try this out\, run the command cd reddit to go inside th
 e reddit project folder\, then run git log. This shows you the most recent
  log messages for changes made to the Reddit source code.\n\n \n\n* Here'
 s another variation on the git log command to try: git log -1 -p --before=
 '2014-03-31 11:52:45'. This is nothing new except for the --before='2014-0
 3-31 11:52:45' part. That tells git you only want to see log entries for c
 hanges made before March 31\, 2014 at 11:52:45am. As you saw in part B\, t
 he -1 means you only want to see one entry\, and the -p means you want to 
 see a diff of the changes. As you can see\, a contributor named "Andre D" 
 changed the mouseover property to "cancelTimeout" from "queueShow" in the 
 file r2/r2/public/static/js/saved.js.\n\n \n\n* Since we have a complete 
 copy of the Reddit project's repository\, we also have a copy of every sna
 pshot going all the way back to the beginning of the project. To see the l
 og entries for the earliest commits\, run the command git log --reverse.\n
 \n \n\n* Recall that each commit is given a unique hash (aka SHA1). Many 
 commands in Git can take a hash as input. For example\, try git log -1 477
 8b17e939e119417cc5ec25b82c4e9a65621b2 and git show 4778b17e939e119417cc5ec
 25b82c4e9a65621b2. (Don't forget that you can use only the first four digi
 ts/characters of the hash. If git complains that the short SHA1 is ambiguo
 us (because more than one commit has the same first four digits)\, try add
 ing a few more digits from the long hash.)\n\n \n\n* One more git log opt
 ion to know about is --skip=N\, where N is a non-negative integer. This me
 ans to skip N commits before starting to show the commit output. Try git l
 og --skip=100 -5.\n\n \n\n* Run a log showing five commits to Reddit (wit
 hout diffs)\, skipping the first N commits\, where N is the first three di
 gits of your UCI student id number. For instance\, if your id is 12345678\
 , then N is 123. Leading zeros are no problem. Redirect the log output to 
 a text file and upload it to Canvas before the deadline.\n\n \n\n* If you
  wanted (and had the permissions)\, you could modify part of the Reddit so
 urce\, commit your changes (on your local repo)\, and then use git push to
  copy your local branch back to the GitHub repository. That's beyond the s
 cope of Informatics 43\, but it's good to know that git is a sophisticated
  tool that facilitates multiple people updating shared files\, logging the
 ir updates\, and assisting with the resolution of updates that conflict.\n

DESCRIPTION:The goal of this assignment is to have you apply the knowledge 
 you learned in this course to a different context\, namely\, fiction writi
 ng. This is great practice in the real-world skill of taking classroom kno
 wledge into different situations. In addition\, this kind of "weakly-cued 
 activity" has been known to help solidify learning long-term.\n\nThis is a
 n optional extra credit assignment\, worth up to 1.5% of your total final 
 course grade. Write a short story (meaning fiction)\, of at least 3-5 page
 s single spaced\, 12-pt. font\, that embodies one or more software enginee
 ring concepts/phenomena taught in this class. The requirements of this ass
 ignment are loose and flexible\, but it must be fiction\, it must read lik
 e a story\, and of course it must be original and not plagiarized (submiss
 ions will be run through turnitin.com).\n\nYour story will be graded rough
 ly according to rubric: https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-d
